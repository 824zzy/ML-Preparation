    "    Model with high bias pays very little attention to the training data and oversimplifies the model. It always leads to **high error** on training and test data.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Model with high variance pays a lot of attention to training data and does not generalize well on the data which it hasn’t seen before.\n",

    "1. Regularization. It involves a cost term for the features involved with the objective function\n",
    "2. Making a simple model. With lesser variables and parameters, the variance can be reduced \n",
    "3. Cross-validation methods like k-folds can also be used\n",
    "4. If some model parameters are likely to cause overfitting, techniques for regularization like LASSO can be used that penalize these parameters"
