    "## 1. Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization ($X_new = (X - X_min)/(X_max - X_min)$) transforms features to be on a similar scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization ($X_{new} = (X - mean)/Std$) is a technique to transform the data into a standard normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also called as Z-score normalization. It is done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Handle missing or corrupted data in a dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dropping the rows or columns with the missing or corrupted dataset\n",
    "- replacing them entirely with a different value are two easy ways to handle such a situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods like IsNull(), dropna(), and Fillna() help in accomplishing this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF formula: $tfidf(t,d) = tf(t,d) * idf(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF stands for **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency**. It is a **numerical statistic** that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in information retrieval and text mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Term frequency, tf(t,d), is the relative frequency of term t within document d.\n",
    "- The inverse document frequency is the logarithmically scaled inverse fraction of the documents that contain the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Deal with imbalanced data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collecting more data\n",
    "- Resampling data to correct oversampling or other imbalances\n",
    "- Generating samples with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (or SMOTE)\n",
    "- Testing various algorithms that include resampling in their design, like bagging or boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is a method of splitting all your data into three parts: training, testing, and validation data. Data is split into k subsets, and the model has trained on k-1of those datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last subset is held for testing. This is done for each of the subsets. This is k-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the scores from all the k-folds are averaged to produce the final score."
