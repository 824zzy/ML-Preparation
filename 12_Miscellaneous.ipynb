    "- Cores: These are the primary computational units of the GPU. Each core can execute a single operation at a time, so more cores generally mean more parallel processing power.\n",

    "- Tensor Cores: These are specialized hardware units designed specifically for performing matrix operations, which are common in deep learning. They can perform mixed-precision matrix multiply and accumulate calculations in a single operation, which can greatly accelerate the training and inference of neural networks.\n",
